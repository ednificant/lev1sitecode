	<h3>Core Philosophy of a Good Web Designer</h3>
	<br>
	<p>Web programming is something that i struggle with times to times. I even be trying to learn new languages in the way but i sometimes fail and give up. I research so much tutorials on how to learn the new languages such as Java scripting, C# and CSS. Html i always been struggling with because i be forgetting some codes which really gets me disappointed.</p>
	<br>
	<p>The main things you should be following throughout your programming years and learning is to design a website that's effective and that you know may be very useful for users to use.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Here are the main cores on what to follow in web designing</p>
	<br>
	<strong><p>1. A layout that allows users to navigate easily throughout the whole site</p></strong>
	<br>
	<p>It’s very important to allow your users to explore your whole site without many disturbance throughout it. Users will want to find what they need quickly. They don't want anything getting between them and their goal. There are various websites that be having plenty of ads in the users way which many very well know that it’s extremely annoying. If the web designer doesn’t maintain a stable website and a easy navigable one users wouldn't want to join that website anymore.</p>
	<br>
	<h4>You may be asking how navigations helps</h4>
	<br>
	<p>Navigation will allow users to easily travel to any pages that you have for them in the website. This makes things 100x easier for the user if they want to find a certain page they are looking.
	It’s not hard for the web designer to put a navigation bar in it’s website. If the developer really wants it’s users to take a while to visit their page they want to visit it wouldn’t be that hard for the developer to do that. He can add some scripts to make ads pop up between you and your page you want to go to.
	</p>
	<br>
	<hr>
	<p>Here are some skills that the web designer must have to design a website for any customer needs.</p>
	<br>
	<h5>1.A graphic designer</h5>
	<br>
	<p>A web designer should know graphic designing if they get into web design because graphic designing you need to be designing layouts on the page and making your own images or you can use free images if its commercial use free.</p>
	<br>
	<h5>HTML programming skills</h5>
	<br>
	<p>This is a obvious one because if you are going to be a web designer, then you will have to be designing the site with code. Even use javascripts for some parts of the website to work. 
	</p>
	<br>
	<h5>Javascripting</h5>
	<br>
	<p>Java scripting isn’t that hard of a code because it involves in some small functions depending on how big it is. If you are trying to mess around with users and mess up their browsers, then you will go all deep into java scripting and using many lines of codes.</p>
	<br>
	<h5>CSS</h5>
	<br>
	<p>This one i struggle with as a level 1 programmer. I really get stressed out because the lines of code your supposed to add just to add a simple box gets complicated. I am still studying on how to learn CSS but for now i’ll halt it for a bit. I think one day i will end up developing a website that involves with lot’s of CSS coding.</p>
	<br>
	<p>These skills will be very important for a web designer. A web designer should always remember these skills so they can continue enhancing it. It’s always good to be learning new programming languages because it will allow you to find a job faster because you know a whole lot of programming skills.</p>
