	<ul>
		<li><b>Computer Maintenance</b> - When i deal with computer maintenance, I be replacing or checking any parts thats damaged or acting a bit. Such as the motherboard, power supply, hard drive disk, cpu, ram, heatsink, and etc. It's always important to be cautious when ever your opening any computer system up.</li>
		<br>
		<li><b>Smartphone Maintenance</b>- Dealing with smartphone maintenance is tough. Do not rush whenever you're opening a smartphone device to replace lcd, speakers, battery, ports, buttons, camera, and etc. It's important to keep your device off. Opening it might be hard for some devices but for most devices should be easy to.</li>
		<br>
		<li><b>Computer Networking</b>- Computer Networking is something that people should start learning now that we are advancing with technology. Computer networking involves with using commands prompts or changing settings in your computer, router, or a server if you own one. One main experience i learned with computer networking is setting up a vpn.</li>
		<br>
		<li><b>Video Editing</b>- Video editing is very easy for many people. You must be creative in your edits. The way i be editing my videos, its by using a cheap or maybe pricy software to edit my video. When your making a film, it's always important to have a intro and outro in it. I use Davinci Resolve to edit my videos. It's free for everyone and has very good features as changing color hue, filters, transitions, and in more depth editing tools. There's many features to check out but i don't want to spoil it all.</li>
		<br>
		<li><b>Music Producer</b>- Music producing is one main habit of mine. Whenever i'm bored at my house, I get on my computer and make some nice decent beats with Fl Studio 12. This program allows me to do a lot with it. I can add in kicks, claps, snares, percussions, and so much more. I don't do much vocals but i'll be working with that later on in the years that come.</li>
		<br>
		<li><b>Track</b>- My favorite outdoor activity is track but i mostly be riding bikes. I love to run because it makes me less stressed out. My fastest speed i ran was 20 mph. The only bad thing is that i get tired quick when i use my full running speed. I need to be conserving enough stamina to win any competitions. Track involves a lot of exercising one main thing that people don't like doing. I don't really like it but i have to do it if i want to become good at track.</li>
		<br>
		<li><b>Computer Programming</b>- Computer programming is the main subject i want to do in my life. I enjoy programming but the problem is that it involves brainstorming a lot which i'm not good at. It involves math because of any x, y, and z coordinates if you are developing a game or not. Programming a website is easy, it takes about 2 minutes to create a simple website without any template on it. The most important part of building a website is having a body to put all of your information for that page you are creating.</li>
		<br>
		<li><b>Graphic Designing</b>- What i do in graphic designing is make good banners, profile pictures, or a advertising picture for a company or friend. It's easy to graphic design if you really put effort into it. I use gimp to edit my pictures and add cool effects to it. The main tools i be using is the zoom tool, resizing tool, and paint brush. </li>
